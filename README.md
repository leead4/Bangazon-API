# Modern Bangazon API Client Application

## Authentication

You will learn how to use the built-in authentication and authorization modules in Django and DRF to create users and handle authenticating requests. You will learn how to use the Token Authentication system rather than the Session Authentication.

## Requirements

We need to build a mobile-response, single page application for use on mobile devices. This project will eventually be used as the prototype for an Ionic application. You are not responsible for that migration.
